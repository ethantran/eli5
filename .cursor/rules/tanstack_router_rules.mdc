# TanStack Router Rules

## File Naming Conventions
- **ALWAYS use `index.tsx` for root routes** with `createFileRoute('/')`
- **NEVER use `_index.tsx` for root routes** - this is for nested index routes within route groups
- Use `_layout.tsx` for layout routes (pathless layouts)
- Use `_authed.tsx` for authentication-wrapped routes
- Prefix files with `-` to exclude them from routing (e.g., `-components/`)
- Use `()` for pathless route groups (organizational only)

## Route Definition Rules
1. **Check file naming first** when troubleshooting routing issues before diving into complex logic
2. **Cross-reference with documentation examples** rather than assuming existing code is correct
3. **Always verify route paths match TanStack Router conventions**:
   - Root route: `index.tsx` with `createFileRoute('/')`
   - Nested routes: `posts.tsx` with `createFileRoute('/posts')`
   - Dynamic routes: `$id.tsx` with `createFileRoute('/posts/$id')`
   - Index routes in nested: `index.tsx` within folder with `createFileRoute('/posts/')`

## Troubleshooting Order
When debugging routing issues:
1. **File naming conventions** - Check if file names follow TanStack Router standards
2. **Route path definitions** - Verify `createFileRoute()` paths are correct
3. **Generated route tree** - Check if `routeTree.gen.ts` is in sync
4. **Router configuration** - Verify router setup and context
5. **Complex logic** - Only then dive into advanced routing logic

## Documentation References
- Always reference [TanStack Router docs](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/routing/routing-concepts) for file naming examples
- Pay attention to actual file names in documentation examples, not just the explanatory text
- When user provides documentation, carefully review the specific examples shown

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Using `_index.tsx` for root routes (should be `index.tsx`)
- Assuming existing code follows conventions without verification
- Focusing on complex routing logic before checking basic file structure
- Not regenerating route tree after file changes
