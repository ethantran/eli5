## Definition of Done âœ… COMPLETE

All acceptance criteria have been met and the guest mode MVP is fully functional:

- âœ… **Users can start chat immediately without signing up**
- âœ… **All 6 education levels work correctly with appropriate mock responses**
- âœ… **Level switching works smoothly via chat bubble interaction**
- âœ… **Session persists during browser session with localStorage**
- âœ… **Conversion flow encourages account creation after engagement**

## Next Priority: Claude AI Integration

With the guest mode foundation complete, the next critical task is **TASK-009: Claude AI Integration** to replace mock responses with actual AI explanations.

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements
- Mock AI responses need replacement with Claude integration (TASK-009)
- Add analytics tracking for guest usage patterns
- Implement progressive web app features  
- Add social sharing capabilities
- Optimize bundle size for faster loading

## Related Tasks
- **TASK-009: Claude AI Integration** (HIGH PRIORITY - next sprint)
- **TASK-006: Authentication** (for conversion flow - medium priority)
- **TASK-012: Mobile Chat Interface** (optimization - low priority)
